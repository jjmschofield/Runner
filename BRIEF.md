Your challenge is to build a small web application that allows athletes to log runs.

An athlete should be able to enter the total time they spent running and the distance they ran, then view a list of recent runs.

When displaying recent runs, the number of calories burned during the run should be displayed alongside the time and distance. The number of calories burned can be calculated using the formula below.

VO2 ~= 2.209 + 3.1633 * kph
Kcal/Min ~= 4.86 * massKg * VO2 / 1000

It is anticipated that this will change in the future, and when it does any previously calculated results should be updated to reflect the new calculation.

Although small in itself, your solution should be written as if it were part of a larger production system including automated tests as appropriate.

The front end to the application need only be functional in design, although artistic flair is appreciated!
